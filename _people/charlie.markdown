description: I just retired after a long career at an electronics company and I wanted to do something for someone less fortunate.  I was fascinated by "Newman's Own",  a non profit food manufacturer set up by Paul Newman.   He has been able to generate more charitable contributions through this company than he could ever have done by just giving money away.   Blue Hen Treats is structured in the same way.  We hope that a small investment in time and money will generate many times that in what would normally be called "profit".   Furthermore, the upside potential is unlimited!
